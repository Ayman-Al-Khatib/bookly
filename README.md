## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The primary framework used for building the app.
- **Dart**: The programming language employed for development.
- **Clean Architecture**: Organizes code into layers (Presentation, Domain, Data) to enhance maintainability and scalability.
- **State Management**: Utilizes reactive programming techniques for efficient state management.
- **Dependency Injection**: Facilitates testing and decouples code.

## üìö Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I have gained practical experience in:

- Implementing Clean Architecture within a real-world Flutter application.
- Structuring code into distinct layers to separate concerns.
- Using dependency injection to manage dependencies effectively.
- Applying state management techniques for building responsive and efficient UIs.
- Debugging and optimizing Flutter applications to improve performance.
